Your response goes here!


Skills Learned:
- Using tags to format and segment text (p tags) at my will on a vanilla HTML document. I have to admit, that project had a lot of manipulation required but was all necessary with just a couple tags! I was impressed by that and am eager to continue! Another isn't necessarily a skill but more of a resource: Mozilla's Developer Network. That will be quite the tool to bookmark.

Easy thus far:
- The file tree and path segment was fairly easy. I've been working with some text editors on python & R projects over the last year or so and have been fairly familiar with that concept. Also the use of a text editor! Using atom and knowing where to get some additional packages made modifying the text in the project a snap!

Difficult thus far:
- For me, so far keeping the structure or "tree" of the HTML document in check. There's a lot of parent/children tags out there and sometimes siblings can confuse, too. Keeping all that in order was a bit chaotic for a moment on this project and I suspect it can only get worse! Not insurmountable, however :).

Problem Strategies used:
- One strategy I developed working on the first project was to get a package for my editor to wrap text in a particular tag! That was extremely useful and ensures I have accurate closing tags. Another was working out how to keep a mental structure of the html in my head so I knew what 'level' I was in the tree. That way I can keep in mind whether or not the tag's content I am editing is a sibling or child to the tag above, that way I can keep my indents accurate.
